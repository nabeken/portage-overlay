Chroot jail howto for unbound

* Rationale

I had no experience whatsoever with chroot jails for daemons, and when making an
ebuild for unbound, someone suggested that I should just check it out.
After lots of playing around with automating a chroot jail setup from within 
the ebuild, everything got way too unstable and far from fool-proof. 

Getting unbound running within a rootjail by hand was no problem however. 
Below are my experiences.

* Assumptions

- You know your way around a linux machine on the console
- You have root access

* Setting it up

1. Emerge unbound, switching USE flags has no effect to the steps in this guide.

2. Decide where you want your rootjail. I choose /var/lib/unbound 
   throughout this manual. Then create the directory:
   # mkdir /var/lib/unbound
   # chown unbound:unbound /var/lib/unbound
   # chmod 700 /var/lib/unbound

3. Inside the chroot you'll need access to /dev/random, and possibly /dev/log 
   (when using syslog, the default). Simplest way is to bind-mount /dev:
   # mkdir /var/lib/unbound/dev
   # mount -o bind /dev /var/lib/unbound/dev

   Hint: add a line to /etc/fstab to keep this persistent between reboots, f.i.:
   /dev   /var/lib/unbound/dev   auto   defauls,bind   0   0

4. Move the config file into the chroot and change some settings:
   # mv /etc/unbound/unbound.conf /var/lib/unbound
   # nano /var/lib/unbound/unbound.conf

   Change following options (or copy/paste these lines near 
   the end of the file):

   chroot: "/var/lib/unbound"
   directory: "/var/lib/unbound"
   pidfile: "/var/lib/unbound/unbound.pid"

5. Change /etc/conf.d/unbound to reflect the new locations of 
   the config and the pid file.

   config_file="/var/lib/unbound/unbound.conf"
   pid_file="/var/lib/unbound/unbound.pid"
